# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

## Introduction

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a key concept in modern DevOps practices. It involves managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable script files, rather than through physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

This repository serves as a guide and collection of examples for implementing IaC in your projects.

## What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

In simple terms, IaC is the process of managing and provisioning infrastructure through code rather than manual processes. It allows you to define, version, and automate the deployment and configuration of infrastructure components.

## Why use IaC?

- **Consistency:** IaC ensures that your infrastructure is consistent across different environments, reducing the risk of configuration drift.
  
- **Reproducibility:** With IaC, you can recreate your entire infrastructure reliably, whether for testing, development, or production.

- **Version Control:** Infrastructure code can be versioned using tools like Git, enabling better collaboration, tracking changes, and rolling back to previous states.

- **Automation:** IaC allows for automation of repetitive tasks, speeding up the deployment process and reducing the chance of human error.
